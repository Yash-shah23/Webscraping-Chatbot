This end-to-end solution was designed to automate and optimize the process of analyzing dental impressions — a crucial step in modern dental diagnostics and treatment planning.\n### **Problem Statement**\nDental clinics and labs often work with a high volume of images, but:\n- Manual inspection is time-consuming and error-prone.\n- Image quality varies, affecting diagnostic accuracy.\n- Detecting dental impressions requires expert intervention.\nWe set out to build a fully automated, intelligent system to improve speed, accuracy, and consistency in dental image analysis.\n### **Solution Delivered**\nWe engineered an AI-powered workflow with the following components.\n**1. Dental Impression Object Detection**\nUsing deep learning-based detection models (such as YOLO and EfficientDet), we trained the system to accurately identify dental impressions in various image conditions. The model was fine-tuned on a diverse dataset, achieving high precision and recall scores in detecting impressions amidst complex backgrounds.\n**2. Image Quality Assessment**\nTo ensure diagnostic-grade results, we integrated an image quality evaluator that analysed.\n- Sharpness: Using edge detection and focus metrics.\n- Brightness: Normalizing underexposed or overexposed images.\n- Only images meeting the quality threshold progressed to the next step, ensuring consistent outputs and reducing false positives.\n**3. End-to-End Automation Pipeline**\nFrom the moment an image is uploaded, our system:\n- Validates and enhances image quality.\n- Detects the presence of dental impressions.\n- Flags any issues for review.\n- Outputs results in a standardised format.\nAll this happens without manual intervention, drastically reducing turnaround time.\n### **Impact & Benefits**\n- Efficiency Boost: Reduced processing time by 75%.\n- High Accuracy: >95% precision in detecting valid impressions.\n- Consistency: Automated quality control ensures uniform diagnostic standards.\n- Scalability: The pipeline can handle hundreds of images per hour with minimal hardware.\n### **Collaboration & Teamwork**\nThis project was a true testament to team collaboration and interdisciplinary expertise — combining data science, machine learning, software engineering, and dental imaging knowledge.\nKetul Chauhan • 5 Min\nExploring the Power of AI Chatbots in E-Commerce\nKetul Chauhan • 4 Min\nHow DevOps Saved the Day\n2025-06-03\nKetul Chauhan • 5 Min\nCase Study: Transforming Dental Imaging with AI – A Computer Vision Success\n### **Project Overview**\nWe recently had the opportunity to push the boundaries of healthcare innovation through a cutting-edge Computer Vision project focused on dental imaging.

This end-to-end solution was designed to automate and optimize the process of analyzing dental impressions — a crucial step in modern dental diagnostics and treatment planning.\n### **Problem Statement**\nDental clinics and labs often work with a high volume of images, but:\n- Manual inspection is time-consuming and error-prone.\n- Image quality varies, affecting diagnostic accuracy.\n- Detecting dental impressions requires expert intervention.\nWe set out to build a fully automated, intelligent system to improve speed, accuracy, and consistency in dental image analysis.\n### **Solution Delivered**\nWe engineered an AI-powered workflow with the following components.\n**1. Dental Impression Object Detection**\nUsing deep learning-based detection models (such as YOLO and EfficientDet), we trained the system to accurately identify dental impressions in various image conditions. The model was fine-tuned on a diverse dataset, achieving high precision and recall scores in detecting impressions amidst complex backgrounds.\n**2. Image Quality Assessment**\nTo ensure diagnostic-grade results, we integrated an image quality evaluator that analysed.\n- Sharpness: Using edge detection and focus metrics.\n- Brightness: Normalizing underexposed or overexposed images.\n- Only images meeting the quality threshold progressed to the next step, ensuring consistent outputs and reducing false positives.\n**3. End-to-End Automation Pipeline**\nFrom the moment an image is uploaded, our system:\n- Validates and enhances image quality.\n- Detects the presence of dental impressions.\n- Flags any issues for review.\n- Outputs results in a standardised format.\nAll this happens without manual intervention, drastically reducing turnaround time.\n### **Impact & Benefits**\n- Efficiency Boost: Reduced processing time by 75%.\n- High Accuracy: >95% precision in detecting valid impressions.\n- Consistency: Automated quality control ensures uniform diagnostic standards.\n- Scalability: The pipeline can handle hundreds of images per hour with minimal hardware.\n### **Collaboration & Teamwork**\nThis project was a true testament to team collaboration and interdisciplinary expertise — combining data science, machine learning, software engineering, and dental imaging knowledge.\nKetul Chauhan • 5 Min\nExploring the Power of AI Chatbots in E-Commerce\nKetul Chauhan • 4 Min\nHow DevOps Saved the Day\n2025-06-03\nKetul Chauhan • 5 Min\nCase Study: Transforming Dental Imaging with AI – A Computer Vision Success\n### **Project Overview**\nWe recently had the opportunity to push the boundaries of healthcare innovation through a cutting-edge Computer Vision project focused on dental imaging.
